#Coding Dojo Helper
Round One - Fight!

Tool for training code katas in Ping Pong style:

- Round 1: Developer A writes first test
- Round 2: Developer B makes the test pass, refactors and writes another test
- Round 3: Developer C (or A again) makes all tests pass, refactors and writes another test
- Round 4 to n: continue as long as the time counts

Works best in groups of 2 - 5 people.
